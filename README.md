# 📊 Airtel Customer Churn Analysis (2024–2025)

**Enterprise-scale telecom churn analysis inspired by Airtel**, built on a **5M+ row synthetic dataset** covering the period **2024–2025**.
The project demonstrates **scalable data handling**, **performance-optimized analytics**, and **end-to-end BI delivery** using **SQL, Python, and Power BI**.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

**SQL | Python | Power BI**

* **SQL** – High-performance querying, churn metrics, customer segmentation on millions of rows
* **Python** – Memory-efficient EDA, statistical analysis, churn behavior exploration
* **Power BI** – Optimized data model, DAX measures, and executive-level dashboards

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a **real-world telecom churn analytics use case** for Airtel using a **large-scale synthetic dataset (5M+ records)** modeled on industry-standard telecom KPIs.

The goal is to:

* Analyze churn behavior at scale
* Identify churn drivers and high-risk customer segments
* Design **actionable, business-ready dashboards**
* Demonstrate **big-data handling and BI optimization skills**

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** The dataset is synthetic and created strictly for learning, analytics, and portfolio demonstration.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Airtel is facing **increasing customer churn** across prepaid and postpaid segments.
The business needs a **scalable analytics solution** to:

* Monitor churn KPIs across millions of customers
* Identify churn drivers by contract, tenure, and services
* Segment high-risk customers early
* Support data-driven retention strategies

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information

* **Rows:** 5,000,000+
* **Type:** Synthetic telecom customer dataset
* **Time Period:** 2024–2025
* **Key Features:**

  * Customer tenure
  * Contract type
  * Internet service
  * Monthly & total charges

## ⚙️ Data Handling & Performance Strategy (5M+ Rows)

To efficiently handle large-scale data:

* SQL queries optimized using **filtering, indexing logic, and aggregations**
* Python EDA performed using:

  * Vectorized operations
  * Sampling for visualization
  * Memory-efficient data processing
* Power BI optimizations:

  * Star schema with a dedicated **Date table**
  * Minimal calculated columns, logic moved to **measures**
  * Optimized DAX using `CALCULATE`, `FILTER`, and context-aware measures
  * Single-page executive dashboard to reduce visual load

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

* **Month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn rate
* Customers with **tenure < 12 months** are significantly more likely to churn
* **Higher monthly charges** increase churn probability
* Customers without **online security and tech support** churn more frequently
* Fiber optic users exhibit higher churn compared to other services

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

* Incentivize long-term contracts for new customers
* Introduce early-tenure retention programs
* Bundle security and tech support services
* Create targeted offers for **high-value, high-risk customers**
* Monitor churn monthly using automated BI dashboards
